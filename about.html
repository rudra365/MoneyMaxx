I live in a country that does not have good offers. Can I use a VPN to access better surveys?<br>
No, VPN usage towards completing surveys is strictly prohibited in Freecash, as per the Terms of Service. Completing offers on a VPN is highly frowned upon by the survey panel companies and constitutes fraudulent completion of offers. As a result, the risk of chargebacks increases. The usage of VPN software to complete offers will result in the termination of your MoneyMaxx account.<br><br>
Can I complete app offers on a mobile device emulator like BlueStacks?<br>
No. This will result in a ban from MoneyMaxx as completing app offers on an emulator constitutes a fraudulent completion of an offer. Consider picking up a cheap burner device to complete offers on!
