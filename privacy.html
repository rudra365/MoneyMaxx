When using our services, you may be required to share personal information about yourself, such as your email address, full name, home address etc. This information is collected for the sole purpose of providing you with suitable surveys and offers. A particular survey may have a determined audience required, so this information helps filter out irrelevant surveys which you would not have qualified for. We will never knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 years of age.
We also collect non-personal information, including your IP address, browser type and cookies. This information allows us to provide you with a better experience and allows us to minimise fraud on our services.<br><br>

3.0 - Cookies and Local Storage<br>
This site uses Cookies to identify your computer and allow us to associate requests from your computer with the relevant user. Local Storage provides useful functionality, such as remembering user preferences from previous browsing sessions.
By using our services, you are agreeing with our use of Cookies and Local Storage outlined above. Cookies and Local Storage may be cleared or blocked at any time, however the functionality of our services will be severely limited if you choose to block them.<br><br>

4.0 - Third Parties<br>
The Site uses third-party partners such as offer walls and survey routers to provide you as a user with offers and surveys. The information that we share with these partners varies depending on the offer type. For regular ‘offers’, the only information we share is your unique ID generated by us to uniquely identify your account. For ‘surveys’, the only information we share is your unique ID, along with any information you have provided to us, which is passed to help the provider filter out irrelevant surveys.
Any third-party services integrated in our site may collect information from you on their own website as well, and they have separate and independent privacy policies. We bear no responsibility or liability for their content and activities. If you are dissatisfied or concerned about any of these third-party privacy policies, please contact us and we will be happy to investigate.<br><br>

5.0 - Sharing of Information<br>
Our policy is to not to share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties for our own personal benefit, however there may be situations where we are required to share your personal details with third parties, such as relevant law enforcement agencies. If we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with law enforcement or other regulatory bodies, we may do so without your prior consent or notice.<br>
We may also share your personal information if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or act regarding situations that pose a threat to the security, rights and assets of the company, or violations to our policies or terms of service. We may also share your personal information if necessary in cases of fraud, such as credit card fraud on offers.
The disclosure of sensitive information to relevant organisations or authorities is up to the sole discretion of the management of the company.<br><br>

6.0 - Security<br>
We take your data protection and sensitivity very seriously. We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including personal information.<br>
The personal information we collect about you is stored in secure servers, hosted by industry-leading hosting providers. We also maintain many security measures to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the personal information within our control.
However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of such information or be responsible for any damage that results from a breach in security. Furthermore, you should be aware that the Internet and other various networking communication media are not entirely secure, and your information may therefore be subject to interception or loss which is beyond our reasonable control. In conclusion, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal information you transmit to us, and any transmission is done at your own risk. Accordingly, we assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of your personal information or other information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our reasonable control.<br><br>
